# Stackbasierte Sprachen
Simple Weatherstation implemented in the stack-based language [Factor](http://factorcode.org/).
Load weather.factor into the scratchpad and calculate average of an indivdual city by calling the word calculate-temp.
For example: `"Vienna" calculate-temp`

## Getting Started
After the factor directory has been added to the `PATH` variable, run the script with `./factor weather.factor`.

## Unit-Tests
To run the unit-tests the file weather-test.factor has to be loaded into the scratchpad.
